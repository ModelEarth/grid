## Capturing Water from Dry Air

### Metal-Organic Framework (MOF)

Discovered at MIT in 2021, porous Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) material in tiny aluminum rods captures water from even dry desert air. In&nbsp;March 2023, a 50% efficiency gain was made by adding two carbon atoms as a linker extension.  Water is captured during the cool of the night. The heat of the day releases the captured water from the aluminum.

Does the following article give us liters-per-day to compare with Source.co solar panels?

## Seawater to Drinking Water in a Few Minutes

[Fast Desalination by Heating the Top of Narrow Tubes](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/desalination-breakthrough-without-electricity)  
June 2024 - Breakthrough in fast, efficient desalination using narrow tubes with the top sides heated to 140 degrees Fahrenheit. The lower side is kept cool, around 68 degrees. Salt ions collect on the colder side. The prior 53 day process using 1-foot pipes has been reduced to only a few minutes by using numerous 1-millimeter tubes.


## Solar Panels that Condense Water from Air

Source.co uses solar panels to condense water from air. Used in over 50 countries, the panels have an internal electric fan to move air through a dry desiccant material to produce 4-5 liters of water per panel per day. They're not using MOF, heated tube tops, or polarized green light, yet. [Source.co](https://www.source.co)

## Super-Thermal Water Evaporation WITHOUT Heat

20% of energy use by industry in spent drying equipment with heat and blowers. Cold polarized green light can evaporate water by cleaving sheets of H20 from the water surface, generating clean water with less energy.
